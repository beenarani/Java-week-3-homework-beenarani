/**
 * 15. Wall Area
 * Write a class with the name Wall. The class needs two fields (instance variables) with name width
 * and height of type double.
 * The class needs to have two constructors. The first constructor does not have any parameters (no-arg
 * constructor). The second constructor has parameters width and height of type double and it needs to
 * initialize the fields. In case the width is less than 0 it needs to set the width field value to 0, in case the
 * height parameter is less than 0 it needs to set the height field value to 0.
 * Write the following methods (instance methods):
 * * Method named getWidth without any parameters, it needs to return the value of width field.
 * * Method named getHeight without any parameters, it needs to return the value of height field.
 * * Method named setWidth with one parameter of type double, it needs to set the value of the width
 * field. If the parameter is less than 0 it needs to set the width field value to 0.
 * * Method named setHeight with one parameter of type double, it needs to set the value of the
 * height field. If the parameter is less than 0 it needs to set the height field value to 0.
 * * Method named getArea without any parameters, it needs to return the area of the wall.
 * TEST EXAMPLE
 * → TEST CODE: (Write bellow code into main method and run and compare result with OUTPUT)
 * Wall wall = new Wall (5, 4);
 * System.out.println("area= " + wall.getArea());
 * wall.setHeight(-1.5);
 * System.out.println("width= " + wall.getWidth());
 * System.out.println("height= " + wall.getHeight());
 * System.out.println("area= " + wall.getArea());
 * → OUTPUT:
 * area= 20.0
 * width= 5.0
 * height= 0.0
 * area= 0.0
 * NOTE: All methods should be defined as public NOT public static.
 * NOTE: In total, you have to write 5 methods and 2 constructors.
